    children: (
      <p>
        It’s an intelligent system that automatically pairs property listings
        with potential buyers based on their preferences, budget, location
        interest, and other filters. Think of it as a digital matchmaker that
        removes the manual searching burden.

    key: "2",
    label: "How does the AI-style matching engine work?",
    children: (
      <p>
        The engine analyzes buyer requirements and compares them with property
        data using weighted factors like price, neighborhood, square footage,
        and amenities. It then ranks the best matches and updates dynamically as
        new listings come in.

  },
  {
    key: "3",
    label: "Can one property match multiple buyers?",
    children: (
      <p>
        Yes. A single listing can be matched with multiple buyers if their
        criteria align. The system ensures each buyer receives recommendations
        that genuinely fit their needs.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    key: "4",
    label: "How does the system detect duplicate or similar listings?",
    children: (
      <p>
        It uses pattern detection to compare addresses, images, descriptions,
        and metadata. If two listings overlap significantly, the system flags
        them as duplicates or merges them to avoid clutter.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    key: "5",
    label: "Does the system send daily updates automatically?",
    children: (
      <p>
        Yes. Buyers and agents receive automatic email updates containing new
        matches, improved matches, and any changes to previously matched
        listings—keeping everyone in the loop without extra effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system provides dashboards for buyer activity, match performance,
        listing insights, engagement tracking, and conversion metrics. Reports
        can be exported and customized based on user roles.
